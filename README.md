# Homework5

The following webpage is a daily scheduler for a user.  All elements are created with a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.  This scheduler consists of a header with a functioning date and time clock.  Below the header is bootstrap table with rows set for each hour of the work day.  Amongst each row are 3 columns.  The first indicates the time, the second is a text area where the user can input daily tasks and events, and the third column has a save button.  Based on the time of day, the event spaces in each row will change color depending on the where they past, present, or future.  

Currently a work in progress, upon click the save button the event will be saved to the local storage and appended to the event space.  Upon refreshing the page, the events will remain until they are rewritten over for a new event.
